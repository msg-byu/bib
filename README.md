# bib
Master bibliography for the Materials Simulation Group at BYU.

The idea is that everyone in the group use this master bibfile. Let's
spend more time writing text and less time formatting bibfiles and
copying information from google scholar or Thomson Reuters...

The naming convention we agreed on (the format for the labels to mark
each bibtex entry) is lastname+year+firstWordOfTitle (this is what
google uses when it generates bibtex output).
