  author={Savitskii, EM and Pravoverov, NL},
  journal={Russ J Inorg Chem},
  volume={6},
  pages={253--254},
  year={1961},
  comment={This paper shows that electrical conductivity, thermal coefficient, and several other things I didn't take time to understand, have concentration dependence that indicates more than just a solid solution for this system. XRD didn't work because they claim it's too hard to tell Ag and Pd apart (similar scattering factors). No idea what the authors mean by Kurnakov phases. Cited literature is really old and not sure it contains claims of ordering. There are 16 citing articles (google scholar).}
}


comment={The idea is given that the ordered phases only occur in the presence of oxygen, either because it affecting kinetics, or because the phase is only stable when oxygen is incorporated. The ordered phase is apparently Ag3Pd. XRD is inconclusive.}
