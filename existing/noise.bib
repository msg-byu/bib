abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 {\%} is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

The method is based on a multiple-scattering description of the electronic structure properties of the random alloy. Configurational order is treated within the generalized perturbation method and the concentration-functional theory. Thermodynamical properties of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ brasses are derived from the cluster variation method.

@article{Ferreira1989,
abstract = {We present a formalism for calculating the temperature-composition phase diagrams of isostructural solid alloys from a microscopic theory of electronic interactions. First, the internal energy of the alloy is expanded in a series of volume-dependent multiatom interaction energies. These are determined from self-consistent total-energy calculations on periodic compounds described within the local-density formalism. Second, distant-neighbor interactions are renormalized into composition- and volume-dependent effective near-neighbor multisite interactions. Finally, approximate solutions to the general Ising model (using the tetrahedron cluster variation method) underlying these effective interactions provide the excess enthalpy $\Delta$H, entropy $\Delta$S, and hence the phase diagram. The method is illustrated for two prototype semiconductor fcc alloys: one with a large size mismatch (GaAsxSb1-x) and one with a small size mismatch (Al1-xGaxAs), producing excellent agreement with the measured miscibility temperature and excess enthalpies. For lattice-mismatched systems, we find 0{\textless}$\Delta$HO{\textless}$\Delta$HD, where O denotes some ordered Landau-Lifshitz (LL) structures, and D denotes the disordered phase. We hence predict that such alloys will disproportionate at low-temperature equilibrium into the binary constituents, but if disproportionation is kinetically inhibited, some special ordered phases (i.e., chalcopyrite) will be thermodynamically stabler below a critical temperature than the disordered phase of the same composition. For the lattice-matched systems, we find 0{\textless}$\Delta$HD{\textless}$\Delta$HO for all LL structures, so that only a phase-separating behavior is predicted. However, in these systems, longer-period ordered superlattices are found to be stabler, at low temperatures, than the disordered alloy.},

abstract = {The short-range order (SRO) present in disordered solid solutions is classified according to three characteristic system-dependent energies: (1) formation enthalpies of ordered compounds, (2) enthalpies of mixing of disordered alloys, and (3) the energy of coherent phase separation (the composition-weighted energy of the constituents each constrained to maintain a common lattice constant along an A/B interface). These energies are all compared against a common reference, the energy of incoherent phase separation (the composition-weighted energy of the constituents each at their own equilibrium volumes). Unlike long-range order (LRO), short-range order is determined by energetic competition between phases at a fixed composition , and hence only coherent phase-separated states are of relevance for SRO. We find five distinct SRO types, and give examples showing each of these five types, including Cu-Au, Al-Mg, GaP-InP, Ni-Au, and Cu-Ag. The SRO is calculated from first principles using the mixed-space cluster expansion approach combined with Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we examine the effect of inclusion of coherency strain in the calculation of SRO, and specifically examine the appropriate functional form for accurate SRO calculations.},

@article{Plimpton1995,
abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers—the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. This},

@article{Mader1995,
abstract = {First-principles and empirical pseudopotentials are used to study the effects of short-range and long- range atomic order on the electronic properties of III-V semiconductor alloys. The alloy structure with a given degree of long- or short-range order is modeled by two types of supercells: (a) Small (16— 32 atom) supercells are constructed in the fashion of the special quasirandom structures (SQS) used previ- ously to simulate random alloys [A. Zunger et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 353 (1990)]. Their electronic structure is treated via first-principles pseudopotential methods. (b) Large ( —1000 atom) supercells are found by a simulated-annealing technique which optimizes the atomic configuration until a given degree of short-range order is reproduced. The electronic structure is then determined using the empirical pseudopotential method. Statistical tests prove that the small cell SQS mimic the much larger supercells and thus provide an efficient means of studying the electronic band structure of disordered alloys in a non-mean-field approach. For the direct band gaps of ideally random Al{\&} „Ga„As, Ga{\&} In„P, and Al{\&}, In As alloys, we find optical bowing parameters b=0.48, 0.46, and 0.52 eV, respectively. In the presence of short-range order in the form of cation clustering, we find the following: (i) Clustering elongates the Ga-P bond and shortens the In-P bond in Gao {\&}Ino 5P and (ii) the optical bowing of the direct band gap is greatly enhanced. This leads to an indirect-gap to direct-gap crossover in Alo {\&}Gao 5As with sufficient clustering. (iii) The band-gap reduction is accompanied by a localization of band-edge wave functions on certain types of clusters. The clusters act as "isoelectronic impurities" which localize states if their concentration (i.e., the degree of short-range order) is large enough. Elec- trons at the conduction-band minimum localize on the cations with lower s-orbital energies. The band- gap reduction and wave-function localization of alloys with short-range order is compared to the effects of long-range order, where the gap reduction is due to level repulsion between zone-folding conduction states. Numerical results are given for CuPt-type long-range order of A1GaAs2, GaInP„and A1InAs{\~{}}. For complete ordering, the band-gap reduction relative to the random alloys are 0.36, 0.49, and 0.16 eV, respectively},

abstract = {In this work, the low temperature part of the Cr–Mo phase diagram is calculated by a combination of first-principles calculations, cluster expansion, and Monte Carlo simulations without the use of empirical parameters. In brief, the miscibility gap in the bcc phase is computed through lattice Monte Carlo simulations with the energetics of the Cr–Mo system represented by cluster expansion Hamiltonians, wherein the Hamiltonians are firstly constructed using first-principles calculations of formation energies for supercells of various bulk compositions. It is demonstrated that the onset (critical) temperature of the miscibility gap is preliminarily computed to be Tc = 1720 K, and is significantly decreased to 1150 K once excess vibrational contribution to the free energy is considered. The resulting solid-state miscibility gap of the Cr–Mo binary system, largely improved by the contributions of atomic relaxation and positive excess volume of mixing in the Cr–Mo bcc alloys, also favors the approaches that extrapolate the Gibbs energy of the bcc phase retrieved at high temperatures, as in the CALPHAD method.},

Quadratic and third-order invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow quantitative measures of cluster symmetries in these systems.

The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative "amorphon" cluster models of glass structure.},

abstract = {.In the 1988 edition of Nature's 'News and Views', J Maddox wrote that 'one of the continuing scandals in physical sciences is that it remains in general impossible to predict the structure of even the simplest crystallographic solids from knowledge of their chemical composition' (Maddox 1988 Nature 335 7). There is, however, the possibility of making some progress in this direction by combining two fundamental areas of physics: quantum mechanics and statistical physics. The starting point is an electronic structure theory density functional theory (DFT) (Hohenberg and Kohn 1964 Phys. Rev. 136 864B, Kohn and Sham 1965 Phys. Rev. 140 1133A) which independently establishes the range (first neighbours, second neighbours, etc), type (pairs, three body, four body, etc) and chemical character (charge transfer, atomic site effects, etc) of the interaction energies. All these can be determined from cluster expansions (CE) (Sanchez et al 1984 Physica A 128 334) which give access to both huge parameter spaces (e.g. for ground-state searches) and systems containing more than a million atoms (e.g. for microstructure studies). It will be shown that, together with Monte Carlo simulations, CE open the possibility of quantitatively studying alloy properties which possess a delicate temperature dependence, such as short-range-order effects, mixing enthalpies or dynamic processes like the ageing of microstructures. This method is extended to alloy surfaces in order to investigate geometric relaxations as well as surface segregation, i.e. the enrichment of one component in the near-surface region. To establish a complementary, experimental view of the geometrical structure and chemical composition of surfaces, experimental low energy electron diffraction spectra are analysed by the use of a multiple-scattering theory (Pendry 1974 Low Energy Electron Diffraction (London: Academic), Van Hove and Tong 1979 Surface Crystallography by LEED (Berlin: Springer)) providing a test of our DFT predicted surface properties.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient approach to accurately finding the ground-state structures in alloys based on the cluster expansion method. In this approach, a small number of candidate ground-state structures are obtained without any information regarding the energy. To generate the candidates, we employ the convex hull constructed from the correlation functions of all possible structures by using an efficient algorithm. This approach is applicable to not only simple lattices, but also complex lattices. First, we evaluate the convex hulls for binary alloys with four types of simple lattice. Then we discuss the structures on the vertices. To examine the accuracy of this approach, we perform a set of density functional theory calculations and the cluster expansion for the Ag-Au alloy and compare the formation energies of the vertex structures with those of all possible structures. As applications, the ground-state structures of the intermetallic compounds CuAu, CuAg, CuPd, AuAg, AuPd, AgPd, MoTa, MoW, and TaW are similarly evaluated. Finally, the energy distribution is obtained for different cation arrangements in the MgAl{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} spinel, for which long-range interactions are essential for the accurate description of its energetics.},

In the field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation - the signal is uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate. This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.},

abstract = {A cluster approach to lattice statistical models is proposed based on the functional formulation used earlier in the gamma-expansion method (GEM). In some respects the approach is superior to the GEM by allowing, for example, for the treatment of models with cluster interactions as well as giving more accurate results. It is argued that the proposed method may turn out to be more efficient than the CVM because (i) it accounts for intersite pair interactions at all distances irrespective of the size of the cluster used in the approximation; (ii) in preliminary calculations it showed much quicker convergence and (iii) with the increase of the cluster size the number of equations grows much more slowly than in the CVM. Besides, the equations are derived via a simple standard routine. This makes feasible their derivation with the use of software for analytical computation, which may be crucial in dealing with large clusters.},

abstract = {Properties of crystalline solutions are generally dependent not only on their chemical composition but also on the configurations of solute atoms and/or point defects. Quantitative knowledge of the configuration-dependent properties is therefore essential for materials design. The cluster expansion (CE) method has been widely used to describe the configurational properties. Increases in computational power and advances in numerical techniques enable us to perform a large set of systematic first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to be combined with CE calculations. In this paper, our procedure of CE with optimal selections of clusters and DFT structures is described. Two examples of such calculations are then shown. One is the cation arrangement in a series of spinel oxides. The other is arrangement of the oxygen vacancy in a series of tin sub-dioxides.},

@article{Zunger2002,
abstract = {Many measurable properties of crystalline binary A(1-x)B(x) alloys, such as phase diagrams and excess thermodynamic functions, could be predicted via lattice statistical mechanics methods if one knew the 'configurational energy'. The latter describes the energy at T = 0 for each of the 2(N) possible occupation patterns of the N lattice sites by an A or a B atom. Traditional approaches described the configurational energy either via empirically fitted, truncated Ising Hamiltonians, or through highly approximated coherent-potential constructs. We illustrate here the alternative approach of 'mixed-basis cluster expansion' which extracts from a set of ab initio local density approximation calculations of the total energies of a few ordered A-B compounds a complete configurational energy function. This method includes both pair and multibody terms, whose number and range of interaction are decided by the variational procedure itself, as well as long-range strain terms. In this paper, we describe the computational details of this method, emphasizing methods of construction, interpolations, fits and convergence. This procedure is illustrated for Ni-Pt, Cu-Au and ScS-squareS (where square denotes cation vacancy). The parameters of the final expansions are provided on our webpage (http://www.sst.nrel.gov).},

Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation.},

abstract = {While as elemental solids, Al, Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Au crystallize in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure, at low temperatures, their 50{\%}-50{\%} compounds exhibit a range of structural symmetries: CuAu has the fcc-based L10 structure, CuPt has the rhombohedral L11 structure, and CuPd and AlNi have the body-centered-cubic B2 structure, while CuRh does not exist (it phase separates into Cu and Rh). Phenomenological approaches attempt to rationalize this type of structural selectivity in terms of classical constructs such as atomic sizes, electronegativities, and electron/atom ratios. More recently, attempts have been made at explaining this type of selectivity in terms of the (quantum-mechanical) electronic structure, e.g., by contrasting the self-consistently calculated total electron+ion energy of various ordered structures. Such calculations, however, normally select but a small, O(10) subset of ‘‘intuitive structures'' out of the 2N possible configurations of two types of atoms on a fixed lattice with N sites, searching for the lowest energy. We use instead first-principles calculations of the total energies of O(10) structures to define a multispin Ising Hamiltonian, whose ground-state structures can be systematically searched by using methods of lattice theories. Extending our previous work on semiconductor alloys [S.-H. Wei, L. G. Ferreira, and A. Zunger, Phys. Rev. B 41, 8240 (1990)], this is illustrated here for the intermetallic compounds AlNi, CuRh, CuPd, CuPt, and CuAu, for which the correct ground states are identified out of ∼65 000 configurations, through the combined use of the density-functional formalism (to extract Ising-type interaction energies) with a simple configurational-search strategy (to find ground states). This establishes a direct and systematic link between the electronic structure and phase stability.},

How many linear measurements do we need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision epsi in the Euclidean (lscr2) metric? This paper shows that if the objects of interest are sparse in a fixed basis or compressible, then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small number of random measurements by solving a simple linear program. More precisely, suppose that the nth largest entry of the vector |f| (or of its coefficients in a fixed basis) obeys |f|(n)lesRmiddotn-1p/, where R{\textgreater}0 and p{\textgreater}0. Suppose that we take measurements yk=langf{\#} ,Xkrang,k=1,...,K, where the Xk are N-dimensional Gaussian vectors with independent standard normal entries. Then for each f obeying the decay estimate above for some 0{\textless}p{\textless}1 and with overwhelming probability, our reconstruction ft, defined as the solution to the constraints yk=langf{\#} ,Xkrang with minimal lscr1 norm, obeys parf-f{\#}parlscr2lesCp middotRmiddot(K/logN)-r, r=1/p-1/2. There is a sense in which this result is optimal; it is generally impossible to obtain a higher accuracy from any set of K measurements whatsoever. The methodology extends to various other random measurement ensembles; for example, we show that similar results hold if one observes a few randomly sampled Fourier coefficients of f. In fact, the results are quite general and require only two hypotheses on the measurement ensemble which are detailed},

By carrying out steepest-descent mappings of system configurations onto potential-energy minima, two main conclusions emerge: (1) a temperature-independent inherent structure underlies the liquid phase, just as for ‘‘simple'' liquids with only pair interactions; (2) the Lindemann melting criterion for the crystal apparently can be supplemented by a freezing criterion for the liquid, where both involve critical values of appropriately defined mean displacements from potential minima.},

Our simulations are based on (a) finite-temperature density-functional theory of the one-electron states, (b) exact energy minimization and hence cal- culation of the exact Hellmann-Feynman forces after each molecular-dynamics step using precon- ditioned conjugate-gradient techniques, (c) accurate nonlocal pseudopotentials, and (d) Nose dynamics for generating a canonical ensemble. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity of the electron-ion ensemble and allows us to perform simulations over more than 30 ps. The computer-generated ensemble describes the structural, dynamic, and electronic properties of liquid and amorphous Ge in very good agreement with experiment. The simulation allows us to study in detail the changes in the structure-property relationship through the metal-semiconductor transition. We report a detailed analysis of the local structural properties and their changes induced by an annealing process. The geometrical, bonding, and spectral properties of defects in the disordered tetrahedral network are investigated and compared with experiment.},

abstract = {We propose a cluster expansion (CE) technique that can express any function of atomic arrangement on any given lattice with the same number of lattice points in a single formalism. In the proposed CE, two types of spin variable, $\sigma$ and $\tau$, on the base lattice and virtual lattice, respectively, are introduced. The former spin variable specifies the occupation of the constituent elements for each lattice point. The latter specifies the positions of each lattice point. Basis functions constructed from the two types of spin variable satisfy completeness and orthonormality for any atomic arrangement on given lattices. As examples, the proposed CE is applied to one- and three-dimensional lattices in a binary system, which clarifies the concept of base and virtual lattices, how the functions of atomic arrangements are expressed in terms of the two types of spin variable, and the efficiency and convergence of the proposed CE with a finite number of clusters and input structures.},

abstract = {The cluster expansion method provides a standard framework to map first-principles generated energies for a few selected configurations of a binary alloy onto a finite set of pair and many-body interactions between the alloyed elements. These interactions describe the energetics of all possible configurations of the same alloy, which can hence be readily used to identify ground state structures and, through statistical mechanics solutions, find finite-temperature properties. In practice, the biggest challenge is to identify the types of interactions which are most important for a given alloy out of the many possibilities. We describe a genetic algorithm which automates this task. To avoid a possible trapping in a locally optimal interaction set, we periodically “lock out” persistent near-optimal cluster expansions. In this way, we identify not only the best possible combination of interaction types but also any near-optimal cluster expansions. Our strategy is not restricted to the cluster expansion method alone, and can be applied to select the qualitative parameter types of any other class of complex model Hamiltonians.},

The approach is based on the description of configurational cluster functions in terms of an orthogonal basis in the multidimensional space of discrete spin variables. The formalism is used to characterize the reduced density matrices (or cluster probability densities) and the free energy functional obtained in the Cluster Variation Method approximation. For the particular representation chosen, the expectation values of the base functions are the commonly used multisite correlation functions. The latter form an independent set of variational parameters for the free energy which, in general, facilitates the minimization procedure. A new interpretation of the Cluster Variation Method as a self-consistency relation on the renormalized cluster energies is also presented.},

VLCE successfully predicted the energy of structures, not only on lattices that are used to obtain interactions, but also of structures on those not used to obtain interactions. VLCE reasonably predicts the stable structure of BN on a honeycomb lattice from information about other lattices.

@article{Kresse1996,
abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ‘‘metric'' and a special ‘‘preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The approach introduces an infinity of orthogonal and complete basis sets in the configurational space of finite clusters, and leads naturally to generalized cluster expansions. In the present approach, the orthogonality of the basis functions is defined with respect to the scalar product given in terms of unrestricted sums over all possible configurations of the cluster. In the thermodynamic limit, this definition of the scalar product corresponds to sums in the canonical ensemble and, as such, the basis are well adapted to describe functions at any fixed concentration.

abstract = {Cluster expansions of first-principles density-functional databases in multicomponent systems are now used as a routine tool for the prediction of zero- and finite-temperature physical properties. The ability of producing large databases of various degrees of accuracy, i.e., high-throughput calculations, makes pertinent the analysis of error propagation during the inversion process. This is a very demanding task as both data and numerical noise have to be treated on equal footing. We have addressed this problem by using an analysis that combines the variational and evolutionary approaches to cluster expansions. Simulated databases were constructed ex professo to sample the configurational space in two different and complementary ways. These databases were in turn treated with different levels of both systematic and random numerical noise. The effects of the cross-validation level, size of the database, type of numerical imprecisions on the forecasting power of the expansions were extensively analyzed. We found that the size of the database is the most important parameter. Upon this analysis, we have determined criteria for selecting the optimal expansions, i.e., transferable expansions with constant forecasting power in the configurational space (a structure-property map). As a by-product, our study provides a detailed comparison between the variational cluster expansion and the genetic-algorithm approaches.},

abstract = {We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighborhood environments, and analyze their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.},

For instance, a structural similarity metric is crucial for classifying structures, searching chemical space for better compounds and materials, and to drive the next generation of machine-learning techniques for predicting the stability and properties of molecules and materials. In the last few years several strategies have been designed to compare atomic coordination environments. In particular, the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) has emerged as a natural framework to obtain translation, rotation and permutation-invariant descriptors of groups of atoms, driven by the design of various classes of machine-learned inter-atomic potentials. Here we discuss how one can combine such local descriptors using a Regularized Entropy Match (REMatch) approach to describe the similarity of both whole molecular and bulk periodic structures, introducing powerful metrics that allow the navigation of alchemical and structural complexity within a unified framework. Furthermore, using this kernel and a ridge regression method we can also predict atomization energies for a database of small organic molecules with a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol, reaching an important milestone in the application of machine-learning techniques to the evaluation of molecular properties.},

abstract = {We describe an iterative procedure which yields an accurate cluster expansion for Au-Pd using only a limited number of ab initio formation enthalpies. Our procedure addresses two problems: (a) given the local-density-approximation (LDA) formation energies for a fixed set of structures, it finds the pair and many-body cluster interactions best able to predict the formation energies of new structures, and (b) given such pair and many-body interactions, it augments the LDA set of "input structures" by identifying additional structures that carry most information not yet included in the "input." Neither step can be done by intuitive selection. Using methods including genetic algorithm and statistical analysis to iteratively solve these problems, we build a cluster expansion able to predict the formation enthalpy of an arbitrary fcc lattice configuration with precision comparable to that of ab initio calculations themselves. We also study possible competing non-fcc structures of Au-Pd, using the results of a "data mining" study. We then address the unresolved problem of bulk ordering in Au-Pd. Experimentally, the phase diagram of Au-Pd shows only a disordered solid solution. Even though the mixing enthalpy is negative, implying ordering, no ordered bulk phases have been detected. Thin film growth shows L1(2)-ordered structures with composition Au3Pd and AuPd3 and L1(0) structure with composition AuPd. We find that (i) all the ground states of Au-Pd are fcc structures; (ii) the low-T ordered states of bulk Au-Pd are different from those observed experimentally in thin films; specifically, the ordered bulk Au3Pd is stable in D0(23) structure and and AuPd in chalcopyritelike Au2Pd2 (201) superlattice structure, whereas thin films are seen in the L1(2) and L1(0) structures; (iii) AuPd3 L1(2) is stable and does not phase separate, contrary to the suggestions of an earlier investigation; (iv) at compositions around Au3Pd, we find several long-period superstructures (LPS's) to be stable, specifically, the one-dimensional LPS D0(23) at composition Au3Pd and two two-dimensional LPS's at compositions Au13Pd4 and Au11Pd4; (v) Au-Pd has a number of unsuspected ground states, including the structure Au7Pd5 with the lowest formation enthalpy and the (301) "adaptive structures" in the Au-rich composition range, all of which could not be predicted by other theoretical methods.},

@article{Lu1992a,
abstract = {In ordered L12-type A3B compounds, each A atom is coordinated by 8A+4B atoms, while each B atom is coordinated by 12A atoms. By symmetry, all A-A, A-B, and B-B bond lengths are equal. When this structure disorders to form the substitutionally random A0.75B0.25 alloy, each atom acquires a distribution of different types of coordination shells. Concomitantly with this reduction in site symmetries, (i) topologically different A atoms (and separately, different B atoms) can have unequal charges, and (ii) the various bonds need not be of equal average lengths {\textless}R{\textgreater} (i.e., {\textless}RA-A{\textgreater} [not equal] {\textless}RA-B{\textgreater} [not equal] {\textless}RB-B{\textgreater}). Furthermore, (iii) there can be a distribution of bond-length values around {\textless}Rij{\textgreater} for each of the three chemical bond types. In this work we study the effects of such charge fluctuations (i) and relaxational fluctuations [(ii) and (iii)] on the electronic structure of Cu3Au and Cu3Pd. The random alloys are modeled by the special quasirandom structure (SQS), whereby the sites of a periodic supercell are occupied by A and B atoms so that the first few radial correlation functions closely reproduce the average correlation functions in an infinite substitutional random network. Instead of requiring that each atom ``see'' an identical, average medium, as is the case in the homogeneous site-coherent-potential approximation (SCPA), we thus create a distribution of distinct local environments whose average corresponds to the random alloy. Application of a first-principles local-density method (linearized augmented-plane-wave method) to the SQS then provides the energy-minimizing equilibrium relaxations, charge density, density of states, and formation enthalpy. We find that charge and relaxational fluctuations neglected in the SCPA lead to a significant stabilization of the alloy ({\~{}}30{\%} lowering in mixing enthalpy) and to substantial ({\~{}}1 eV) nonrigid shifts in the electronic energy levels.},

These SQS's are shown to be short-period superlattices of 4–16 atoms/cell whose layers are stacked in rather nonstandard orientations (e.g., [113], [331], and [115]). Since these SQS's mimic well the local atomic structure of the random alloy, their electronic properties, calculable via first-principles techniques, provide a representation of the electronic structure of the alloy. We demonstrate the usefulness of these SQS's by applying them to semiconductor alloys. We calculate their electronic structure, total energy, and equilibrium geometry, and compare the results to experimental data.},

abstract = {The theory of phase stability in the Ni-Au alloy system is a popular topic due to the large size mismatch between Ni and Au, which makes the effects of atomic relaxation critical and also to the fact that Ni-Au exhibits a phase separation tendency at low temperatures, but measurements at high-temperature show an ordering-type short-range order. We have clarified the wide disparity which exists in the previously calculated values of mixing energies and thermodynamic properties by computing 'state-of-the-art' energetics (Cull-potential, fully-relaxed LDA total energies) combined with 'state-of-the-art' statistics (k-space cluster expansion with Monte Carlo simulations) for the Ni-Au system. We find: (i) LDA provides accurate mixing energies of disordered Ni1-x Au-x alloys (Delta H-mix less than or equal to + 100 meV/atom) provided that both atomic relaxation (a similar to 100 meV/atom effect) and short-range order (similar to 25 meV/atom) are taken into account properly. (ii) Previous studies using empirical potentials or approximated LDA methods often underestimate the formation energy of ordered compounds and hence also underestimate the mixing energy of random alloys. (iii) Measured values of the total entropy of mixing combined with calculated values of the configurational entropy demonstrate that the non-configurational entropy in Ni-Au is large and leads to a significant reduction in miscibility gap temperature. (iv) The calculated short-range order agrees well with measurements and both predict ordering in the disordered phase. (v) Consequently, using inverse Monte Carlo to extract interaction energies from the measured/calculated short-range order in Ni-Au would result in interactions which would produce ordering-type mixing energies, in contradiction with both experimental measurements and precise LDA calculations.},

abstract = {We describe a formalism to predict diffusion coefficients of substitutional alloys from first principles. The focus is restricted to vacancy mediated diffusion in binary substitutional alloys. The approach relies on the evaluation of Kubo-Green expressions of kinetic-transport coefficients and fluctuation expressions of thermodynamic factors for a perfect crystal using Monte Carlo simulations applied to a cluster expansion of the configurational energy. We make a clear distinction between diffusion in a perfect crystal (i.e. no climbing dislocations and grain boundaries that can act as vacancy sources) and diffusion in a solid containing a continuous distribution of vacancy sources that regulate an equilibrium vacancy concentration throughout. A variety of useful metrics to characterize intermixing processes and net vacancy fluxes that can result in the Kirkendall effect are described and are analyzed in the context of thermodynamically ideal but kinetically non-ideal model alloys as well as a realistic thermodynamically non-ideal alloy. Based on continuum simulations of diffusion couples using self-consistent perfect-crystal diffusion coefficients, we show that the rate and mechanism of intermixing in kinetically non-ideal alloys is very sensitive to the density of discrete vacancy sources. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Devising a computational tool that assesses the thermodynamic stability of materials is among the most important steps required to build a ``virtual laboratory'', where materials could be designed from first-principles without relying on experimental input. Although the formalism that allows the calculation of solid state phase diagrams from first principles is well established, its practical implementation remains a tedious process. The development of a fully automated algorithm to perform such calculations serves two purposes. First, it will make this powerful tool available to large number of researchers. Second, it frees the calculation process from arbitrary parameters, guaranteeing that the results obtained are truly derived from the underlying first-principles calculations. The proposed algorithm formalizes the most difficult step of phase diagram calculations, namely the determination of the ``cluster expansion'', which is a compact representation of the configurational dependence of the alloy's energy. This is traditionally achieved by a fit of the unknown interaction parameters of the cluster expansion to a set of structural energies calculated from first-principles. We present a formal statistical basis for the selection of both the interaction parameters to include in the cluster expansion and of the structures to use in order to determine them. The proposed method relies on the concepts of cross-validation and variance minimization. An application to the calculation of the phase diagram of the Si-Ge, CaO-MgO, Ti-Al, and Cu-Au systems is presented.},

abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchangecorrelation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density, It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

abstract = {Refractory metals present a potential for development of future high-temperature structural materials due to their high melting temperature and good high-temperature strength. However, their poor high-temperature oxidation resistance, creep resistance, and low fracture toughness at low temperatures have to be addressed. The microstructure of two Cr-Ni-Ti-Al alloys is characterized using XRD, LOM, SEM, and TEM. The microstructure of both alloys is comprised of very dilute Cr solid solution grains, intergranular L21 Ni2AlTi phase, and fine NiTi-rich B2 precipitates dispersed in the Cr-rich grains. The small spherical precipitates have a well-defined orientation relationship with the Cr-matrix, and the lattice mismatch between the precipitates and the Cr-alloy matrix is accommodated by the interface dislocations. In order to explain measured composition of L21 and B2, the site preference in these phases is further studied using the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) method at the low temperature limit. The theoretical calculations predict that Al prefers substituting for the Ti site in B2 NiTi. Structure analysis reveals that Al substituting for Ti results in the formation of strong Al-Ni bonds that have much shorter bond lengths than the Al substitution for the Ni site. The predicted Al site or Cr site preference is consistent with established Al-Ni-Ti ternary experiments. As for the L21-Ni2AlTi phase, DFT calculations predict that Cr prefers substitution with the Ni site over Al or Ti sites. This is related to the smallest relaxation effect and formation of stronger Al-Cr and Ti-Cr bonds that have much shorter nearest neighbor bond length compared to other substitution scenarios.},

@article{Hart2008,
abstract = {We present an algorithm for generating all derivative superstructures—for arbitrary parent structures and for any number of atom types. This algorithm enumerates superlattices and atomic configurations in a geometryindependent way. The key concept is to use the quotient group associated with each superlattice to determine all unique atomic configurations. The run time of the algorithm scales linearly with the number of unique structures found.},

abstract = {Different methods of cross-validation are studied for their suitability to guide variable-selection algorithms to yield highly predictive models. It is shown that the commonly applied leave-one-out cross-validation has a strong tendency to overfitting, underestimates the true prediction error, and should not be used without further constraints or further validation. Alternatives to leave-one-out cross-validation and other validation methods are presented. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Diaz-Ortiz2007a,
abstract = {Multiscale modeling of materials based on cluster expansions has been performed hitherto assuming that the input data, either from first-principles or experimental observations, were noise-free. Our systematic analyses on archetypical systems subjected to Gaussian numerical noise revealed that cluster expansions act as noise filters. This unexpected and remarkable feature has a deep impact on the way we approach the modeling of material properties and how we construct future databases.},

All the terms in the CEA for Al-rich AIX alloy can be determined uniquely and successively from low-order to high-order by using the total energies of isolated Al and X atoms, pure Al and X metals, and X impurities in Al metal. The total energies of impurity systems are calculated accurately by using the all-electron full-potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (FPKKR) Green's function method, combined with the density-functional theory in the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), we show: (1) the binding energies of X (X = Cu, Zn) impurities in Al are reproduced very well by the CEA including two- and three-bodv interaction energies of X impurities; (2) the chemical trends of Structural stability among ordered Structures (Ll(2), DO22, DO23) of Al3X (X = Sc, Ti, V), being determined by use of the screened-FPKKR and GGA band-structure calculations. are reproduced by the CEA including only two-body (X-X) interaction energies in Al.},

The new code, UNiversal CLuster Expansion (UNCLE), consolidates recent advances in the methodology and leverages one new development in the formalism itself. As a core goal, the package reduces the need for user intervention, automating the method to reduce human error and judgment. The package extends standard cluster expansion formalism to the more complicated cases of ternary compounds, as well as surfaces, including adsorption and inequivalent sites.},
